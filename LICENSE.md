                affiliated with the product must listen to the 
                "Der Ententanz" (AKA "The Chicken Dance") as 
                composed by Werner Thomas for no less than two 
                (2) minutes
            * For every twenty-thousand (20000) units distributed, 
                two (2) or more persons affiliated with the entity 
                must be recorded performing the full Chicken Dance, 
                in an original video at the entity's own expense,
                and a video encoded in OGG Theora format, at least

                received with this software. If you have not 
                received instructions on how to do the Chicken
                Dance, then the dance must be chicken-like in nature.
