// these activities, the system will disable some or all of the heuristics so your application
// can finish quickly while still providing responsive behavior if the user needs it.
//
// These activities can be used when your application is performing a long-running operation.
// If the activity can take different amounts of time (for example, calculating the next move
// in a chess game), it should use this API. This will ensure correct behavior when the amount
// of data or the capabilities of the user's computer varies. Be aware that failing to end
// these activities for an extended period of time can have significant negative impacts to
// the performance of your user's computer, so be sure to use only the minimum amount of time
// required. User preferences may override your applicationâ€™s request.
