# Mocha

An umbrella framework replacement for Cocoa with category-based additions, extensions, and fixes.

The framework as a whole is still very **experimental** and should be used with caution, but a majority of its extensions and fixes are bug-proof.

## Platform Requirements

- OS X 10.7+
- 64-bit Modern Objective-C ABI
- LLVM/Clang 4.0+ Toolchain (Xcode 4.4+)
